# Statamic Glide Directive

- ðŸš€ Automatic responsive images - Optimizes images for all devices automatically.
- âš¡ Performance boost - Serves correctly sized images, reducing load times and bandwidth.
- ðŸ§© Simple syntax - Clean `@responsive` directive replaces complex `<picture>` tags.
- ðŸ”„ WebP support - Automatically delivers modern image formats to compatible browsers.

## Installation

```bash
composer require justbetter/statamic-glide-directive
```

## Usage
This package adds a Blade directive. You can use an asset in the directive, and it will render the image according to the presets defined in the config. Here's an example:

```php
@responsive($image, [
    'alt' => 'This is an alt text.', 
    'class' => 'some classes here',
    'loading' => 'lazy'
])
```

To allow images to change on resize, include this in your head:
```php
@include('statamic-glide-directive::partials.head')
```

### Image Generation

Images are served directly through custom routes that properly handle the content type and caching. When a preset image is requested, it's generated on demand and stored in the public directory.

We recommend pre-generating your presets for optimal performance:
```bash
php please assets:generate-presets
```

For larger sites with many images, consider using Redis for your queue connection:
```php
// Set in your .env file
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
```

When using a queue (like Redis), image generation will happen in the background without affecting page load times. If an image preset hasn't been generated yet, a placeholder will be used temporarily until the optimized version is ready.

## Config
The package has default configurations. By default, it will use the presets defined in this addon's config. If you've defined your asset presets in the Statamic config, those will be used.

Default config:
```php
'presets' => [
    'placeholder' => ['w' => 32, 'h' => 32, 'q' => 100, 'fit' => 'crop_focal'],
    'xs' => ['w' => 320, 'h' => 320, 'q' => 100, 'fit' => 'crop_focal'],
    'sm' => ['w' => 480, 'h' => 480, 'q' => 100, 'fit' => 'crop_focal'],
    'md' => ['w' => 768, 'h' => 768, 'q' => 100, 'fit' => 'crop_focal'],
    'lg' => ['w' => 1280, 'h' => 1280, 'q' => 100, 'fit' => 'crop_focal'],
    'xl' => ['w' => 1440, 'h' => 1440, 'q' => 100, 'fit' => 'crop_focal'],
    '2xl' => ['w' => 1680, 'h' => 1680, 'q' => 100, 'fit' => 'crop_focal'],
],
```

### Image Resize Threshold
This setting defines the threshold width for image source sets. Images wider than this threshold will be processed differently to optimize performance.

```php
'image_resize_threshold' => 480
```

### Placeholder
On page load, a small variant of the image will be loaded. To disable this, set the placeholder in the config file:
```php
'placeholder' => true,
```

### Sources
Configure which sources to use. By default, only WebP sources are used. You can also configure sources based on the image MIME type or use both.
```php
'sources' => 'webp',
```

### Publish Configuration
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JustBetter\ImageOptimize\ServiceProvider"
```
